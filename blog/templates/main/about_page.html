                <p>Hello, my name is Piotr Szewc</p>
                <p>My main speciality and passion are in data, finding what is hidden. I could describe it as “Data
                    Analytics” what means: “Data Science, Data Mining, Text Mining, Machine Learning, Statistical
                    Learning,
                    Statistics, Analytics Modeling, Business Analytics, Knowledge Discovery, Soft Computing, Natural
                    Language Processing, Data Aggregation, Econometrics, Visualization & related Programming:
                    Descriptive -,
                    Predictive -, & Prescriptive Analytic” as short anything that need to derive something out of your
                    data,
                    any tool, algorithm, technique, method or programing language to achieve that.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Aside from working as Analyst, I also like to enjoy hiking, playing basketball, gym, cooking for my
                    colleagues and friends, and different types of books
