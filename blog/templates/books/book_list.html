                    Programming Using Python:</a>
                This is the best course on introductory python I have seen and got me going. It is a time-consuming
                course, but the problems they give are in depth, well-explained, and
                organized thoroughly. Some of the questions are HARD, but I think that is better than the opposite of
                everything being too simplified.</p>
            <p><a class="h5" href="">Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow:</a>
                This book is specifically designed for readers who already have a relatively good understanding of
                programming. It serves as a comprehensive and fast-paced introduction into the essentials of Tensorflow
                & Scikit-Learn, and how to use them to build intelligent models and systems. Keep in mind that
                familiarity with Python is a necessary prerequisite before reading. This book is jam-packed with
                exercises to consolidate understanding, and covers a broad range of topics with varying complexities
                across the Machine Learning process.
            </p>
            <p><a class="h5" href="">Deep Learning:</a>
                Deep Learning is written by a famous ex-Googler, providing a rich and detailed guide into one of A.I’s
                most exciting sub-fields, “Machine Learning”. This has to be one of the best machine learning books out
                there at the moment. In this book you will learn about Neural Networks and how to construct them for
                various use-cases. It’s been backed by our industry thought-leaders such as Elon Musk who has commented
                on how comprehensive this book truly is.

                    Startup Owner's Manual:</a>
                One of the best books for startups in addition to "Lean Startup". Steve Blank makes a lot of very good
                points about
                startup growth and culture, i.e. what makes startups succeed and what makes others fail. He also goes
                into significant depth on what you and your business can do to minimise the risk of failure.</p>

                    What makes things popular? If you said advertising, think again. People don’t listen to advertisements, they listen to their peers. But why do people talk about certain products and ideas more than others? Why are some stories and rumors more infectious? And what makes online content go viral?</p>
